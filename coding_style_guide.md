# Coding style for this project
- _Variables_
    * Use lowercase and underscore for normal variable names
    * Use uppercase characters for global variables
    * Variable names should be relevant to their usages
- _Functions_
    * Use lowercase and underscore for function names
    * Function names should be relevant to their usages
    * Temporary variable names used in functions should not be the same as outer scope ones
- _Operators_
    * Arithmetic operators should have a whitespace on both sides of them
    * Assignment operator should have a whitespace on both sides of it, but not when they are used for default settings
    * Commas should have a space after them, but not before
    * A whitespace should be used to separate parentheses if they are nested (3 or more)
    * No parentheses needed for returning a tuple
- _Comments_
    * Do not use ''' for block quote
    * At least one whitespace should be added between # and text
    * Use TODO if necessary
- _Indentation and blank lines_
    * One blank line should be reserved at the end of the file
    * Add one blank line between functionally different code blocks
    * At least one blank line should be added between functions
    * At least two blank lines should be added between the import section and the rest of the code
    * Indent with tabs rather than spaces
